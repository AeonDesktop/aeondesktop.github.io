		<h2>Who is Aeon For?</h2>
		<div>Aeon is perfect for the "lazy developer" who prefers to spend their time getting work done while letting their desktop take care of itself. The OS is static, automated and reliable, letting you focus on your apps and work.</div>

		<div>Aeon has a clear vision of a reliable and consistent experience across all installs, which may not be the perfect environment for a hardcore system-tinkerer - there's still Tumbleweed and Leap for scratching that itch.</div>

			<div class="card">Reliable, Predictable, Immutable</div>
